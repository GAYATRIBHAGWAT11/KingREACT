dealing with number , boolea, number always go with use state

array and object => usestate

item={
    name:'ice cream",
    price:100,
    quantity:4,
    totalPrice:()=> this.price+this.quantity
}

usememo will take 2 functions 1 is function and 2nd is dependencies list


as state changes function also get called again

if 3 states declared and wann ude 2 state then use usenemo

1 thing or 2 things are changing use useMemo
